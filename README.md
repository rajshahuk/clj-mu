Clojure friendly library for using https://muserver.io

This library has been written to allow more a _clojure-ey_ way to use MuServer. It has been written
with a few to keep dependencies down to a minimum and as a result does not try to compatible with
other popular frameworks such as ring or compojure. This library has however been heavily inspired
by them after more than a year of building services with them.
